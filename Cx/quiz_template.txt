% You need to provide a quiz question with four multiple choice answers.
% There should be at least one correct answer among the choices.
% More than one correct answers are permitted.
% For correct answers you should begin with \correctchoice and others with \choice.
% The answers should be motivated very well by explaining  why an option is correct or wrong.

% Below we have provided an example question with two correct answers appropriately motivated.
% Please edit the text in the example,
%    mark the correct answer,
%    write the motivation,
%    save this file,
%    and submit back to pingpong.
% No need to compile the file.


\question Select the right option with respect to fading and it's effects: 

\begin{choices}

  \choice Flat Fading (Has Doppler effect) and Frequency Selective (No Doppler effect)  & Slow fading (has ISI) and Fast Fading (No ISI)
	% MOTIVATION : Flat and Frequency Selective Fading depends on delay spread and delay spread affetcs ISI. Similarly, Slow and Fast Fading depends on coherence time and coherence time causes the doppler effect.

  \choice Flat Fading (Has ISI) and Frequency Selective (No ISI)  & Slow fading (Has Doppler effect) and Fast Fading (No Doppler effect)
	% MOTIVATION : This is the opposite of the right option. Symbol time >> Delay spread implies fast fading. Symbol time << delay spread implies frequency selective. Symbol Time << Coherence time implies implies slow fading. Symbol time >> Coherence time implies fast fading.

  \choice Flat Fading (No Doppler effect) and Frequency Selective ( Has Doppler effect)  & Slow fading (No ISI) and Fast Fading (has ISI)
	% MOTIVATION : Flat and Frequency Selective Fading depends on delay spread and delay spread affetcs ISI. Similarly, Slow and Fast Fading depends on coherence time and coherence time causes the doppler effect.

  \correctchoice Flat Fading (No ISI) and Frequency Selective (has ISI)  & Slow fading (No Doppler effect) and Fast Fading (Has Doppler effect)
	% MOTIVATION : This is the right relation. Symbol time >> Delay spread implies fast fading => There is no ISI. Symbol time << delay spread implies frequency selective => There is ISI. Symbol Time << Coherence time implies implies slow fading. Symbol time >> Coherence time implies fast fading.
